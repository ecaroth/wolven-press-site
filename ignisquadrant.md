Some folks would describe THE IGNIS QUADRANT as a story as that of a man afraid to let go of the past, as he deals with shame and regret, while unknowingly searching for a purpose.
Others (including myself) would just describe it as a not-so-serious jaunt around a familiar yet unique space setting, cut with halfway-decent humor and a big splash of action and adventure.

THE IGNIS QUADRANT has crowdfunded 5 issues and our first TPB on Kickstarter successfully!

We have started production on the next story arc of The Ignis Quadrant, so look for more coming soon!

## How to Die in the Quad

In addition to the series, we've been hard at work on an amazing anthology that takes place in The Ignis Quadrant.

HOW TO DIE IN THE QUAD features a selection of 7 page stories from some of your favorite indie and published sci-fi authors and artists, all taking place in The Ignis Quad universe and all themed with one central overarching theme -- Death!

The anthology is well on it's way to completion (about 85%) and will come to Kickstarter after we wrap up Issue #5 of the series -- stay tuned for lots more info on that!
