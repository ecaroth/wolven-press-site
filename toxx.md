#### The Story

Thirty years ago the ozone layer weakened, allowing radiation to pummel the the Earth, killing billions, accelerating evolution and mutation, and rendering the human race sterile. But against all odds, a woman miraculously becomes pregnant and must find a way to stay alive as multiple groups vie for control of her and her unborn child's future.


#### The Details

TOXX is a post-apocolyptic 5 issue mini-series, about one woman's fight for a brighter future.

TOXX was successfully <a href="https://www.toxxcomic.com" target="_blank">Kickstarted</a> over multiple campaigns, and was published in the direct market by Blood Moon comics.

You can purchase TOXX Volume 1, 150+ pages collecting the first 5 issues over at the <a href="https://shop.wolven.press/" target="_blank">Shop</a>.

As part of my last Kickstarter for TOXX Vol 1, I created an entirely new standalone, free-to-read story in the TOXX universe, titled CARAVAN OF CORPSES!

You can download the PDF for free in the shop, or read the series <a href="https://globalcomix.com/c/caravan-of-corpses" target="_blank">over on Global Comix</a> which has all the releases.
